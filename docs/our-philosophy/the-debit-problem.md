# The Debt Problem

**All the problems today are due to to a DEBT paradigm, which is a value based on a negative scale**: in nature negative values does not really exists, or at least it’s equal to zero.

Physically you cannot own `-1` stones, woods or apples; in the same way money is not a product of nature, something that grows on a tree and can be harvested.<br>
Real values are made by *something more*, or *something different*.<br>
The negative scale is not related to real stuff but is an economical conceptual representation: this driven the entire world from the post-war era to the industrial epoch, but today, the action of constantly removing is simply unuseful and totally in the wrong way on the street of the welfare.<br>
Today we can see this uncontainable drama (our *fake-aboundancy*) widespread in all segments of society and, in general, extended to all of the World.<br>
Our current monetary system generates scarcity and competition.<br>
All the politics, restrictions, wars and singular personal troubles are linked to this question: *where the negative sign will go on?*

<br>

> <small>*An even deeper obstacle to examining our system of money resides in the recesses of our collective: <b>We are motivated both by a fear of scarsity and by greed.</b><br>
> Fear of scarcity often carries with it a tendency to avoid facing the reality of our finances, and greed brings an obsessive focus on money.<br>
> The conflict between these two forces leads to a state of approach-avoidance in relation to money - an inner struggle that further exacerbates the trickness of the inquiry.<br>
> Money itself becomes highly emotionally charged.*

> By understanding how money really works, we we're creating a different system that supports the kind of society we desire for ourselves and for future generations. This is about how to make a sustainably abundant future a reality.* (Ibid.)<br></small>

Looting day by day nature resources, was created a fake sense of progress based on the fact that scarsity is not here, but that was simply moved from one place to another (in general imperial colonies - 3rd and 4rd worlds), so today we have one more big trouble: we are too much using that old system and there are no other places sustaining that paradigm.<br>
We have at least `-2` planets!<br>
That’s why every year the [Earth Overshoot Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Overshoot_Day) is anticipating more and more...

This concept is well drawn by the "*impossible hamster"* theory...

### How phantoms have pushed mankind to kill itself
As we can saw, the current paradigm is based to an old debt-based money system and to an unexisting compound interests, so the exponential growth in the long run is failed, because *infinite growth* is mathematically impossible in a *finite* world.<br>
The application of a *compound interest* (paying interest on interest) obligate all of us to find additional money to cover back the first one, so in the end not only *everything* is now possesed by a small bank group - which are a *legal ghost commonly accepted as "person"* - but **everyone is pushed to abuse each-others moved by scarsity of numbers on screens!**<br>
Phantoms have pushed us to fight, kill and be really dangerous to ourself in the name of false-aboundancy.<br>
This process is still going on...<br>

The current paradigm is the **Debit** and you can see it ever written on all bancomat card.

This not means - as they wants you think - that "*money are directly moved from your account"* because if so it should say "*direct transfer*", or "*direct*" or - otherwise - "*to revision*".

Instead, when you see wrote "credit", this means that "*the bank allow you to spend a bit until a certain maximum, and you have to pay an extra fee for this service, and you are subject to a fiscal revision*"… that’s a bad debt anyway and not a real credit!

## Some reports

!!! warning "[Oxfam, Time to care, 2020 Report](https://www.oxfam.org/en/research/time-care)<br>The scale of the gap between rich and poor today"
    The gap between the super-rich and the rest of society remains unimaginably huge.

    * In 2019, the world’s billionaires, only 2,153 people, have more wealth than 4.6 billion people.
    * The 22 richest men have more wealth than all the women in Africa.
    * The world’s richest 1% have more than twice as much wealth as 6.9 billion people.
    * If you saved $10,000 a day since the building of the pyramids in Egypt you would have one-fifth the average fortune of the 5 richest billionaires.
    * If everyone were to sit on their wealth piled up in $100 bills, most of humanity would be sitting on the floor. A middle-class person in a rich country would be sitting at the height of a chair. The world’s two richest men would be sitting in outer space.
    * The monetary value of women’s unpaid care work globally for women aged 15 and over is at least $10.8 trillion annually – three times the size of the world’s tech industry.
    * Taxing an additional 0.5% of the wealth of the richest 1% over the next 10 years is equal to investments needed to create 117 million jobs in education, health and elderly care and other sectors, and to close care deficits.

!!! warning "[UNCTAD, World Investment Report 2019](https://unctad.org/webflyer/world-investment-report-2019)"

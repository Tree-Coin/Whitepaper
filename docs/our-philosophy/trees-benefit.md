# Trees Benefit
Trees provide enormous ecosystem benefits, such as reduction of atmospheric CO₂, global warming, air refreshment and purification, supporting and hosting the life of cross-pollinators, like bees, essential for agriculture and pollination of fruits and vegetables. Therefore the credit-currency aims to allow anyone to be a beneficiary, administrator and protector of land and trees, especially to keep them safe from cutting, which has become a noxious practice...

-	agriculture

# The Tree Coin® credit-note

Like paper money are printed with faces, by which you can give trust, printed Tree Credits have trees dynamically generated, based on the amount, the current moon and the season.

Basically, just seeing the paper-credit drawing you can guess:

* **The season**\
  from the tree colour
* **The moon phase**\
  drawn behind
* **The amount**\
  by the abundance of the foliage (not yet in the example above)

The generation date is printed below the drawn tree.

The **Tree Coin® (TREE)** credit-note is a vertical note for three reasons:

* can be displayed on mobile devices
* can be easily printed on multiple versions on a vertical A4
* it’s completely different from conventional money (which are horizontal) and this must be remarked

Unlike conventional banknotes it also reports positive messages, such as "Ethical and circular economy based on mutual trust and respect_"_ and "For goodwill and trust_"_.\
This is done for ethical reasons and to extend as long as possible its own positivity.

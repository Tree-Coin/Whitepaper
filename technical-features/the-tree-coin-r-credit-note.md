# The Tree Coin® credit-note

The **Tree Coin® (TREE)** credit-note is a vertical note for three reasons:

* can be displayed on mobile devices
* can be easily printed on multiple versions on a vertical A4
* it’s completely different from conventional money (which are horizontal) and this must be remarked

Unlike conventional banknotes it also reports positive messages, such as “Ethical and c_ircular economy based on mutual trust and respect_” and “_For goodwill and trust_”. This is done for ethical reasons and to extend as long as possible its own positivity.​​Sample of printed 21,36 TREE Credits

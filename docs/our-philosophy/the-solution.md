# The solution (on the flip side of the coin)

In a world based a **negative scale**, all resources are made by plunder the nature.
In the same time we assist to an irreparable negative trend of all economies of the world, because all economies are based on the same paradigm: **recursive debt and resource depredation**.

**This is not we want anymore, so the key is pretty simple: let's do the exact opposite!**

## Credit and tree protection together
We thought of a **totally opposite economic system**, therefore parallel and independent from the current one, supported by the principle of cryptocurrencies but independent from all global FIAT currencies and easy scalable between current crypto chains: the **Tree Coin**.

The **Tree Coin**, with its free ecological sustainability aims to become the concrete ecological platform for linking sustainable development, providing effective supply at the service of ecological benefits, protecting healthy tree from burning, is therefore the key for allow cross-pollinators (insects) being harboured in freshness and from their nets pollinate the various flowers and agricultural crops.
Bees need trees: and we all know the Einstein’s Say: "4 years after the bees collapse, mankind will be over".

The **Tree Coin** value is based on consensus on fair and ethical ecological benefit of Biological produce and Living Trees, unlike other currencies which are based on gold or pure speculation.
The reason is simple: a planet without trees is no living planet!
Therefore the **Tree Coin** is a true **hymn to life**: it may sustain ecosystem benefits of trees and related forestry wildlife and CO₂ reduction to sustain the world population.
In fact, in less than 30 years, at a rate of increase is estimated at **81 million people per year the** world will count on a population of [about 8 billions of humans](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/) of which **851,331,777 undernourished** according to the [State of world food insecurity by FAO](https://www.fao.org/publications/sofi/en/).

## Financing Eco-villages
We do not produce *money*, *coins* or *shitcoins* and we do not want to remove resources to no one, so we do not ask to buy or exchange money for our parallel economic system.<br>
Simply we encourage you to use other common, parallel values.<br>
If you want to help us you can <a href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=A7YZNW8QTPYVC" target="_blank">support our project</a> but is a different stuff...

Eco-villages are the future of new sustainable economy and societal aggregation and therefore the **Tree Coin** is also perfect for funding the establishment, keeping and growth of Eco-villages and communities and for the sustaining of their circular economy: they may be exchanged to buy goods and exchange services and reward volunteering work, for environmental protection as well as for guaranteeing long term social welfare, and therefore allowing overall economical and ecological sustainable development from local to global scale, as also foreseen by Multilateral Agencies, Nongovernmental Organizations and CBOs (Community Based Organizations), always in ethical, consensual and non-monetary way (debt).

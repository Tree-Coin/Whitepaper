# The Tree Coin® logo

The Tree Coin® logo is designed by a totally automated script based on algorithms, which changes color at every season’s: brilliant in Spring and Summer, brownish in Autumn and Winter... like a living tree!!!

It enriches the symbolic value of the Tree Coin® itself by underlying the real value of tree life for the entire Planet.

Like paper money are printed with faces, that provides the trust, printed Tree Credits have trees dynamically generated, based on the amount, the current moon and the season.

Basically, just seeing the paper-credit drawing you can guess:

* **The season**\
  from the tree colour
* **The moon phase**\
  drawn behind
* **The amount**\
  by the abundance of the foliage (not yet in the example above)

The generation date is printed below the drawn tree.

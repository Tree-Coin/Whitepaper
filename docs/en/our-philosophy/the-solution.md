# The solution

In a world based a **negative scale**, all resources are made by plunder the nature.<br>
In the same time we assist to an irreparable negative trend of all economies of the world, because all economies are based on the same paradigm: **recursive debt and resource depredation with continuous and fast growing widespread poverty**.<br>
All governments and deputated institutions try all the time to recover, fix and correct the down progress, but there are not other ways:<br>
**The economic paradigm of false-abundancy it's ended up to its term.**<br>

## Credit and tree protection together
*On the flip side of the coin*, we thought of a **totally opposite economic system**, therefore parallel and independent from the current one, supported by the principle of cryptocurrencies but independent from all global FIAT currencies and easy scalable between current crypto chains: the **Tree Coin**.

The **Tree Coin** aims to become the concrete ecological platform for linking sustainable development, providing effective supply at the service of ecological benefits and protecting healthy tree from burning.<br>
With its free ecological sustainability is therefore the key for allow cross-pollinators (insects) being harboured in freshness and from their nets pollinate the various flowers and agricultural crops.<br>
Bees need trees: and we all know the Einstein’s Say: *"4 years after the bees collapse, mankind will be over"*.

^^The **Tree Coin** value is based on life^^, on the well-being pushed by the evolution itself and on fair and ethical ecological benefit of biological entities: this is well represented by living Trees, in opposite way of other currencies which are based on gold, other dead stuffs or on pure abstract speculations...<br>
We aim to sustain life and growing things: as well as a planet without trees is not a living planet, mankind without projects it's at the end of its own evolution.<br>
Therefore the **Tree Coin** is a true **hymn to life**: it may sustain the ecosystem, the benefits of trees and related forestry wildlife, and so CO₂ reduction to sustain the world population.

<!-- In fact, in less than 30 years, at a rate of increase is estimated at **81 million people per year the** world will count on a population of [about 8 billions of humans](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/) of which **851,331,777 undernourished** according to the [State of world food insecurity by FAO](https://www.fao.org/publications/sofi/en/). -->

## Financing Eco-villages
As we do not want to produce *money* as commonly intended, we do not want to remove resources to no one, so we do not ask you to buy or do exchanges, because the ^^Tree Coins are a parallel economic system^^.<br>
Simply we encourage you to use other common, parallel values, and for do this we provide you a new metric for your exchanges, and also the values.<br>
Tree Coins are already yours, simply agree and use it with your friends and your community.

Eco-villages are the future of new sustainable economy and societal aggregation and therefore the **Tree Coin** is also perfect for funding the establishment, keeping and growth of Eco-villages and for sustain of their circular economy.<br>
TREEs may be exchanged to buy goods and exchange services, reward volunteering work (eg. for environmental protection) and for guaranteeing long term social welfare, and therefore allowing overall economical and ecological sustainable development from local to global scale, as also foreseen by Multilateral Agencies, Nongovernmental Organizations and CBOs (Community Based Organizations), always in ethical, consensual and non-monetary way (by debt).

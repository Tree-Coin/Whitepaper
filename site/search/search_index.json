That\u2019s why every year the Earth Overshoot Day is anticipated more and more\u2026 This is well drawn by the \u201c impossible hamster\u201d theory\u2026 The current paradigm is ever based on Debit and you can see it ever written on all bancomat card.

Sample of a Debit card you already have in your wallet. You can see the text \"Debit\" as declaration of the current economic paradigm The solution In a world based a negative scale , all resources are made by plunder the nature. In the same time we assist to an irreparable negative trend of all economies of the world, because all economies are based on the same paradigm: recursive debit and resource depredation . This is not we want anymore, so the key is pretty simple: let\u2019s do the exact opposite! Credit and tree protection together We thought of a totally opposite economic system , therefore parallel and independent from the current one, supported by the principle of cryptocurrencies but independent from all global FIAT currencies and easy scalable between current crypto chains: the Tree Coin \u00ae . The Tree Coin \u00ae , with its free ecological sustainability aims to become the concrete ecological platform for linking sustainable development, providing effective supply at the service of ecological benefits, protecting healthy tree from burning, is therefore the key for allow cross-pollinators (insects) being harboured in freshness and from their nets pollinate the various flowers and agricultural crops. Bees need trees: and we all know the Einstein\u2019s Say: \u201c4 years after the bees collapse, mankind will be over\u201d. The Tree Coin \u00ae value is based on consensus on fair and ethical ecological benefit of Biological produce and Living Trees, unlike other currencies which are based on gold or pure speculation. The reason is simple: a planet without trees is no living planet! Therefore the Tree Coin \u00ae is a true hymn to life : it may sustain ecosystem benefits of trees and related forestry wildlife and CO\u2082 reduction to sustain the world population. In fact, in less than 30 years, at a rate of increase is estimated at 81 million people per year the world will count on a population of about 8 billions of humans of which 851,331,777 undernourished according to the State of world food insecurity by FAO . Financing Eco-villages We do not produce shitcoins and we do not want to steal money to no one, so we do not ask to buy or exchange money for our crypto. If you want you can support our project but is totally different from selling or exchange virtual bits\u2026 Eco-villages are the future of new sustainable economy and societal aggregation and therefore the Tree Coin \u00ae is also perfect for funding the establishment, keeping and growth of Eco-villages and for the sustaining of their circular economy: they may be exchanged to buy goods and exchange services and reward volunteering work for environmental protection as well as for guaranteeing long term social welfare, and therefore allowing overall economical and ecological sustainable development from local to global scale, as also foreseen by Multilateral Agencies, Nongovernmental Organizations and CBOs (Community Based Organizations), always in ethical, consensual, non monetary (debt) way. Tree Coin \u00ae in a nutshell The Tree Coin \u00ae (TREE) is an ECOLOGICAL and completely ethical CREDIT and therefore, in the legal and fiscal terms, does not belong to the standard FIAT currencies and not-directly to other cryptocurrencies for the following reasons: Info The Tree Coin \u00ae (TREE) has undetermined value and is granted for free or by free offer; It\u2019s a circular economy based on CREDIT, thought to be spread through Associations, neighbour groups and ecovillages; Its value DOES NOT correspond to any FIAT currency or to other cryptocurrencies because is exclusively based on the consensus between humans, in order to favourite the exchange of real economy goods; It is a barter facilitator , a third numerical parameter NOT a Currency: you cannot exchange or buy the CREDIT by itself, but you can use it for make donations or do comparisons; The credit granting paradigm means giving before asking for a service and not paying after it is done. So if you entitle someone the task to do something for you, you are granting trust and energy for a certain period of time. You give credit for something after which you can confirm it, renew or revoke\u2026 STOP SCAMS! Credits are linked to moon and solar phases , as each goods of our Mother Earth; Is a real circular economy and you can\u2019t ever go down less zero: it represents \u201chow much we can do\u201d, so the total amount is algorithmically designed to renew itself periodically. This means that you can spend all that you have and see your credit periodically resetted to the initial amount, because you are a human being and so until you are not able, you cannot lose the will to do stuff!

This is done for ethical reasons and to extend as long as possible its own positivity.","title":"The Tree Coin\u00ae ecological concept"},{"location":"un-sustainable-development/participation-to-un-global-goals/","text":"The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals are 17 GOAL 1: No Poverty GOAL 2: Zero Hunger GOAL 3: Good Health and Well-being GOAL 4: Quality Education GOAL 5: Gender Equality GOAL 6: Clean Water and Sanitation GOAL 7: Affordable and Clean Energy GOAL 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth GOAL 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure GOAL 10: Reduced Inequality GOAL 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities GOAL 12: Responsible Consumption and Production GOAL 13: Climate Action GOAL 14: Life Below Water GOAL 15: Life on Land GOAL 16: Peace and Justice Strong Institutions GOAL 17: Partnerships to achieve the Goal Participation to UN Global Goals The Tree Coin \u00ae (TREE) project allow anyone attaining the goal of possessing land and trees, as well as to establish Eco-villages, relying on the concept of Sustainable Development and Climate Change reduction and better life conditions, in attainment of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), promulgated by the United Nations General Assembly on 25 September 2015.

When someone considers trees as renewable fuel or \u201cbiomasses\u201d for producing electricity, this is simply a nonsense, because burning a tree releases 150% CO\u2082 of fossil Coal and therefore this practice is highly detrimental for global warming (PFPI, Biomass is the New Coal, 2014). Bio-energy has traditionally been used by certain sectors such as the paper-making industry but a lot of new wood burning plants have in the US, more than 70 new wood-burning plants have been built or are underway since 2005, and another 75 proposed and in various stages of development, fuelled by renewable energy subsidies and federal tax credits. In most states, biomass power is subsidized along with solar and wind as green, renewable energy, and biomass plant developers routinely tell host communities that biomass power is \u201cclean energy\u201d. But this first-ever detailed analysis of the bioenergy industry reveals that the rebooted industry is still a major polluter. Comparison of permits from modern coal, biomass, and gas plants shows that even the \u201ccleanest\u201d biomass plants can emit >150% the nitrogen oxides, >600% the volatile organic compounds, >190% the particulate matter, and > 125% the carbon monoxide of a coal plant per megawatt-hour, although coal produces more sulfur dioxide (SO2). Emissions from a biomass plant exceed those from a natural gas plant by more than 800% for every major pollutant (ibidem). Biomass power plants are also a danger to the climate, emitting nearly 50 percent more CO\u2082 per megawatt generated than the next biggest carbon polluter, coal. Emissions of CO\u2082 from biomass burning can theoretically be offset over time, but such offsets typically take decades to fully compensate for the CO\u2082, rapidly injected into the atmosphere during plant operation. Compounding the problem, bioenergy facilities take advantage of gaping loopholes in the Clean Air Act and lax regulation by the EPA and state permitting agencies, which allow them to emit even more pollution. Electricity generation that worsens air pollution and climate change is not what the public expects for its scarce renewable energy dollars. Biomass power plants are disproportionately polluting not just because of their low efficiency (in converting heat to electrical output) and high emissions inherent in burning wood for energy, but also because the bioenergy industry exploits and actually depends on important loopholes in the Clean Air Act and its enforcement, loopholes that make bioenergy far more polluting than it would be if it were regulated like fossil fuels. Scientific review of 88 air permits of biomass power plants tabulated information on facility size, fuel use, pollution control technology, and allowable emissions. Some of the facility permits were issued under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program in the Clean Air Act, which requires \u201cmajor sources\u201d of pollution to reduce emissions by conducting a the Best Available Control Technology (BACT) analysis, and also requires facilities to conduct air quality modelling that assesses whether they will violate EPA\u2019s air quality standards and threaten health. Therefore protecting tree from becoming biomass signifies protecting consumer\u2019s health and environmental value. For small facilities, the 250 ton per year cap in a synthetic minor permit means they can emit far more pollution than necessary, given their size; for large plants, the cap requires they must meet unrealistically low emissions rates in order to emit less than 250 tons per year. In one case, where citizen petitioners protested a 24 MW plant in Hawaii that had been granted synthetic minor status, EPA agreed that the facility\u2019s emission limits were unenforceable and that the plant should likely be regulated as a major source. Most biomass plants have no restrictions on hazardous air emissions In 88 bioenergy permits been scientifically scrutinised scientists have found almost no accountability for emissions of hazardous air pollutants (HAPs), a group of especially toxic pollutants that includes hydrochloric acid, dioxins, carcinogens like benzene and formaldehyde, and heavy metals like arsenic, lead, and cadmium. Emissions of HAPs from biomass burners are barely regulated (ibidem). In addition to that Under the biomass MACT rule, a major source biomass plant using a stoker boiler is allowed to emit more than 27 times the particulate matter of a coal boiler, and EPA rules allow most biomass plants to emit more than 10 times the particulate matter of a commercial and industrial waste incinerator. The rules for waste incinerators limit emissions of specific HAPs, including some heavy metals, but the rules for biomass plants do not contain any such limits. As more and more contaminated fuels are being burned as biomass, the lack of limits on emissions of HAPs is bound to increase emissions of the most toxic compounds from so-called \u201cclean\u201d bio-energy (ibidem). Also a standing invitation of Scientist to the European Parliament points out the necessity to limit the term \u201cbiomass\u201d only to ligneous residual and wastes.

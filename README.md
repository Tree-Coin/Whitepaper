# Tree Coin Whitepaper

The Tree CoinÂ® is an alternative solidarity model linked to an electronic symbol, the Tree Coin Logo, as academic Non-Financial, Non-Monetary, Non-Currency solidarity experiment.\
Its a solidarity symbol.\
I's based on CREDIT, on sustainability, on mutual trust, respect for others and Mother Nature.

Forget economic troubles, you can generate your \[ethical-artistic-note] by yourself and share it with your circles as alternative collaborative instrument.

Tree Coin maybe freely experimented following the lunar phases and regenerated every lunar cycle, as the plants in Mother Nature.

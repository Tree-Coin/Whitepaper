# Tree Coin Whitepaper



The Tree CoinÂ® is an alternative economic model linked to a crypto, based on CREDIT, on sustainability, on mutual trust, respect for others and Mother Nature.

Forget economic troubles, you can generate your credit-note by yourself and share it with your circles as alternative payment method.

You cannot own less than 1'000 TREE, so on each lunar phase your wallet will be restored automatically.

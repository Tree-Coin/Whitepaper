# The Tree Coin® logo

The Tree Coin® logo is designed by a [totally automated script based on algorithms](https://github.com/Tree-Coin/Logo), which changes color at every season’s: brilliant in Spring and Summer, brownish in Autumn and Winter... like a living tree!!!

It enriches the symbolic value of the Tree Coin® itself by underlying the real value of tree life for the entire Planet.

# Trees and Sustainable Development

In our concept trees are essentially source of life, animal shelter and ecological baseline, since they reduce Co² emissions and release the oxygen we breath.\
When someone considers trees as renewable fuel or "biomasses" for producing electricity, this is simply a nonsense, because burning a tree releases 150% CO² of fossil Coal and therefore this practice is highly detrimental for global warming (PFPI, Biomass is the New Coal, 2014).

Bio-energy has traditionally been used by certain sectors such as the paper-making industry but a lot of new wood burning plants have in the US, more than 70 new wood-burning plants have been built or are underway since 2005, and another 75 proposed and in various stages of development, fuelled by renewable energy subsidies and federal tax credits.\
In most states, biomass power is subsidized along with solar and wind as green, renewable energy, and biomass plant developers routinely tell host communities that biomass power is "clean energy".\
But this first-ever detailed analysis of the bioenergy industry reveals that the rebooted industry is still a major polluter.\
Comparison of permits from modern coal, biomass, and gas plants shows that even the "cleanest" biomass plants can emit >150% the nitrogen oxides, >600% the volatile organic compounds, >190% the particulate matter, and > 125% the carbon monoxide of a coal plant per megawatt-hour, although coal produces more sulfur dioxide (SO2).\
Emissions from a biomass plant exceed those from a natural gas plant by more than 800% for every major pollutant (ibidem).

Biomass power plants are also a danger to the climate, emitting nearly 50 percent more CO² per megawatt generated than the next biggest carbon polluter, coal.\
Emissions of CO² from biomass burning can theoretically be offset over time, but such offsets typically take decades to fully compensate for the CO², rapidly injected into the atmosphere during plant operation.

Compounding the problem, bioenergy facilities take advantage of gaping loopholes in the Clean Air Act and lax regulation by the EPA and state permitting agencies, which allow them to emit even more pollution.\
Electricity generation that worsens air pollution and climate change is not what the public expects for its scarce renewable energy dollars.

Biomass power plants are disproportionately polluting not just because of their low efficiency (in converting heat to electrical output) and high emissions inherent in burning wood for energy, but also because the bioenergy industry exploits and actually depends on important loopholes in the Clean Air Act and its enforcement, loopholes that make bioenergy far more polluting than it would be if it were regulated like fossil fuels.\
Scientific review of 88 air permits of biomass power plants tabulated information on facility size, fuel use, pollution control technology, and allowable emissions. Some of the facility permits were issued under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program in the Clean Air Act, which requires “major sources” of pollution to reduce emissions by conducting a the Best Available Control Technology (BACT) analysis, and also requires facilities to conduct air quality modelling that assesses whether they will violate EPA's air quality standards and threaten health.\
Therefore protecting tree from becoming biomass signifies protecting consumer’s health and environmental value.

For small facilities, the 250 ton per year cap in a synthetic minor permit means they can emit far more pollution than necessary, given their size; for large plants, the cap requires they must meet unrealistically low emissions rates in order to emit less than 250 tons per year. In one case, where citizen petitioners protested a 24 MW plant in Hawaii that had been granted synthetic minor status, EPA agreed that the facility's emission limits were unenforceable and that the plant should likely be regulated as a major source.

#### Most biomass plants have no restrictions on hazardous air emissions

In 88 bioenergy permits been scientifically scrutinised scientists have found almost no accountability for emissions of hazardous air pollutants (HAPs), a group of especially toxic pollutants that includes hydrochloric acid, dioxins, carcinogens like benzene and formaldehyde, and heavy metals like arsenic, lead, and cadmium. Emissions of HAPs from biomass burners are barely regulated (ibidem).

In addition to that Under the biomass MACT rule, a major source biomass plant using a stoker boiler is allowed to emit more than 27 times the particulate matter of a coal boiler, and EPA rules allow most biomass plants to emit more than 10 times the particulate matter of a commercial and industrial waste incinerator.\
****The rules for waste incinerators limit emissions of specific HAPs, including some heavy metals, but the rules for biomass plants do not contain any such limits. As more and more contaminated fuels are being burned as biomass, the lack of limits on emissions of HAPs is bound to increase emissions of the most toxic compounds from so-called "clean" bio-energy (ibidem).

Also a standing invitation of Scientist to the European Parliament points out the necessity to limit the term “biomass” only to ligneous residual and wastes.

#### According to Scientists there is need of 1 trillion trees to reduce atmospheric CO².

Interpolating the 1,633,502 hectares of Forest loss and [35,753,305,000 of CO² emissions (tons)](https://www.worldometers.info/co2-emissions/), the 3,769,240 hectares of Desertification as well as 3,075,819 tons of Toxic chemicals released in the environment this year only ([www.wordometers.info](http://www.wordometers.info)) we urge an adequate approach to revert these economic trends and ensure sustainable development for all.

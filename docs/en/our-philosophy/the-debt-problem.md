# The Debt Problem

**All the problems today are due to to a DEBT paradigm, which is a value based on a negative scale.**<br>
In nature negative values does not exists, or at least it’s equal to zero.<br>
You cannot own `-1` physical stones, woods or apples, as money is not a product of nature, something that grows on a tree and can be harvested.

The negative scale is not related to real stuff but is a pure conceptual economics representation: was useful to stimulate the world from the post-war era til today, but it can be used by privates to push societies *over* totalitarian dictatorships and/or mass manipulations.<br>

    An example of our "perfect" society (based on scarcity).<br>
    This is happening NOW, just behind your house...

Negative scales means *constantly removing* and so during times the welfare gone down, down, down... Today each of us can see the effects and this is simply unuseful and totally in the wrong way, on the street of the common welfare.<br>

Negative scales ate our brains, putted us against each other and focused all common attention on the principle of scarcity: today being rich means that someone else is poor.<br>
An economy based on the negative scale means homeless and empty homes, drivers without vehicles but showrooms full of new flaming cars parked on display... shortage on one hand and waste on the other!


Almost each Country in the World is using a monetary system that generates scarcity and competition.<br>
We can see this uncontainable drama (our *fake-aboundancy*) widespread in all segments of society and, in general, extended to all of the World.<br>
All the politics, restrictions, wars and singular personal troubles are linked to this question: *where the negative sign will go on?*<br>

<br>
<br>

!!! tip
    Values are made by a mutual agreement on estimation for *something equivalent*, whatever is.<br>
    But we are still using a monetary system that generates scarcity and competition.

<br>

> <small>*An even deeper obstacle to examining our system of money resides in the recesses of our collective: <b>We are motivated both by a fear of scarcity and by greed.</b><br>
> Fear of scarcity often carries with it a tendency to avoid facing the reality of our finances, and greed brings an obsessive focus on money.<br>
> The conflict between these two forces leads to a state of approach-avoidance in relation to money - an inner struggle that further exacerbates the trickness of the inquiry.<br>
> Money itself becomes highly emotionally charged.*

> *Money is merely a human construct, as will be shown, that was designed in and for another age.<br>
> By understanding how money really works, we we're creating a different system that supports the kind of society we desire for ourselves and for future generations. This is about how to make a sustainably abundant future a reality.* (Ibid.)<br></small>

<br>

The plundering of daily natural resources has created a fake sense of progress based on the fact that scarcity is not here, but that was simply moved from one place to another (in general past imperial colonies - today 3rd and 4rd worlds), so today we have one more big trouble: we are too much using that old system and there are no other places sustaining that paradigm.<br>
We have at least `-2` planets!<br>
That’s why every year the [Earth Overshoot Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Overshoot_Day) is anticipating more and more...

This concept is well drawn by the "*impossible hamster"* theory...

### How phantoms have pushed mankind to kill itself
As we can saw, the current paradigm is based to an old debt-based money system and to an unexisting compound interests, so the exponential growth in the long run is failed, because *infinite growth* is mathematically impossible in a *finite* world.<br>
The application of a *compound interest* (paying interest on interest) obligate all of us to find additional money to cover back the first one, so in the end not only *everything* is now possesed by a small bank group - which are a *legal ghost commonly accepted as "person"* - but **everyone is pushed to abuse and fraud each-others moved by scarcity of numbers on screens!**<br>
Phantoms have pushed us to fight, kill and be really dangerous to ourself in the name of false-aboundancy.<br>
This process is still going on...<br>

    Sample of a Debit card you already have in your wallet.<br>
    You can ever see the text "Debit" as declaration of the current economic paradigm
  </figcaption>
</figure>
You can see the proof of the current Debit paradigm always written on all ATM cards. Open your wallet and check now!<br>
This not means - as they wants you think - that "*money are directly moved from your account"* because if so it should say "*direct transfer*", or "*direct*" or "*to revision*"...<br>
Instead, when you see wrote "credit", this means that "*the bank allow you to spend a bit until a certain maximum, and you have to pay an extra fee for this service, and you are also subject to a fiscal revision*"… that’s a bad debt anyway and not a real credit!

## Some official reports on what explained

!!! warning "[Oxfam, Time to care, 2020 Report](https://www.oxfam.org/en/research/time-care)<br>The scale of the gap between rich and poor today"
    The gap between the super-rich and the rest of society remains unimaginably huge.

    * In 2019, the world’s billionaires, only 2,153 people, have more wealth than 4.6 billion people.
    * The 22 richest men have more wealth than all the women in Africa.
    * The world’s richest 1% have more than twice as much wealth as 6.9 billion people.
    * If you saved $10,000 a day since the building of the pyramids in Egypt you would have one-fifth the average fortune of the 5 richest billionaires.
    * If everyone were to sit on their wealth piled up in $100 bills, most of humanity would be sitting on the floor. A middle-class person in a rich country would be sitting at the height of a chair. The world’s two richest men would be sitting in outer space.
    * The monetary value of women’s unpaid care work globally for women aged 15 and over is at least $10.8 trillion annually – three times the size of the world’s tech industry.
    * Taxing an additional 0.5% of the wealth of the richest 1% over the next 10 years is equal to investments needed to create 117 million jobs in education, health and elderly care and other sectors, and to close care deficits.

!!! warning "[UNCTAD, World Investment Report 2019](https://unctad.org/webflyer/world-investment-report-2019)"
    *The free trade commerce concentrate on average on 1% of the companies of each country the 57% of the production export*
